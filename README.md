# DHB_invariant_representation

This repository contains MATLAB and Python scripts to implement DHB invariant representation of rigid body motions. The original code was written by [Matteo Saveriano](https://github.com/matteosaveriano/DHB_invariant_representation).

## Components description
The folder _DHB_Invariants_ contains 3 scripts:
- ```computeDHB.m```: Compute DHB invariants given a Cartesian trajectory.
- ```reconstructTrajectory.m```: Reconstruct a Cartesian trajectory from its DHB invariant representation.
- ```mainDHB.m```: Simple demo script.

The code is compatible with Matlab and Octave.

## Software Requirements
The code is developed and tested under _Matlab 2015b_.

## Usage
We prepared a simple demo in ```mainDHB.m``` to show how a Cartesian 6D trajectory is transformed into a set of DHB invariants and vice versa.
